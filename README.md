### Verifying on block explorers, from the UI

![m57](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/2e185ee2-6e88-4d46-999b-7e1b6adfde18)
On eherscan we can verify and publish our contract code <br>

right now our code looks like huge byte code <br>

and anybody looking at our contract directly on chain will see huge bytecode <br>

we can use decompiler to decompile the bytecode into what it looks <br>
like in solidity <br>


But this can take a long time and lot of processing power <br>

so we can make it esaier by verifying and publishing trhe code by ourselves <br>


for that we click the above arrow marked verify and publish option <br>

![m58](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/a1edfe2f-1c93-46d6-9b3f-b65f70c4d6f2)
here we cann add compiler information to compile this on etherscan <br>

![m59](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/37be848c-6a3a-412b-b519-22c4dde6513e)

we have added the above information <br>

![m60](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/1039271b-0e55-497a-a6bd-72a7939b6355)

then we click the ```Continue``` button <br>


![m61](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/824c7994-093c-47e4-85b0-3decc6e2e27a)


we paste the code here shown above <br>

![m62](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/12537aa9-56bf-4b46-91d7-2fd012ce9cbb)

we will click the above button <br>

![m63](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/39307e71-45f1-4427-846d-97b7a13b5af4)

then we will see that our contract is successfully compiled <br>


![m64](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/3f0fa386-7300-4caf-ad76-746775d91c1b)

if we click the button shown with black arrow we will see our whole code <br>

![m65](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/8fb28538-f92b-42a6-ba22-ee0c9edf5d6c)

we will copy our this contract address <br>


![m66](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/c4f4bcee-f64a-458e-bf49-11fbb06e6229)

now if we paste it at filter we can see that anybody can read our contract code and that is what we <br>
called smart contract to be transparent <br>

![m67](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/8db3abbf-589c-407b-8916-c259a7527049)
the button we saw at remix to read from our contract we can see it here <br>

![m68](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/8d0707d2-4785-473b-a7fd-7122046a4b13)
the button we saw at remix to write from our contract we can see it here <br>

![m69](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs11/assets/89090776/b291c8b5-da34-48a7-99bb-9b04364d26c4)

if we click this read contract button and click the retrieve button we can see it return 7 <br>

thus our contract is verified <br>


using larger or complex code can make verfication process a much harder <br>


### Alchemy dashboard and the Mempool 

Alchemy can teach us and show us a lot about transaction <br>

also teach us baout things that are going behind the scene <br>
