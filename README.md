On eherscan we can verify and publish our contract code <br>

right now our code looks like huge byte code <br>

and anybody looking at our contract directly on chain will see huge bytecode <br>

we can use decompiler to decompile the bytecode into what it looks <br>
like in solidity <br>


But this can take a long time and lot of processing power <br>
